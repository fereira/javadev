 * Thrown if Canvas returns a retriable response, for example, a 504, Gateway Timeout.
 * This usually means that the front end web server has timed out while waiting for the
 * application server to complete the request. The request could still be in flight on
 * the application server but there is no guarantee as to what state it is in.
 * Usually you will probably want to retry the request.
